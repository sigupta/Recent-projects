/**
 * Represents a FPGA accessible by RIFFA. The usage pattern is:
 *    Fpga f = Fpga.open(...);
 *    f.send(...);
 *    f.recv(...);
 *    f.close(...);
 *
 * The static method list can be used to get a listing of the FPGAs installed in
 * the system and their ids. You'll need the FPGA id to pass to the open method.
 * If only 1 FPGA is installed in the system, it's id will always be 0.
 *
 * In the send and recv methods below use java.nio.ByteBuffer instead of a
 * byte[] to represent the data for sending and buffer for receiving data. The
 * java.nio.ByteBuffer class is used because the underlying byte[] can easily be
 * accessed. But more importantly, it has methods to reinterpret the underlying
 * byte[] into other primitive array types (e.g. int[]) without copying the
 * contents of the array. Copying arrays (especially large arrays) will reduce
 * throughput considerably and is best to be avoided. Use the allocateDirect
 * method on ByteBuffer to create a new instance. Then use one of the asXXXBufer
 * methods to acquire the appropriate java.nio.Buffer subclass. The example
 * below illustrates this:
 *    java.nio.ByteBuffer bb = java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(NUM_INTS*4);
 *    java.nio.IntBuffer ib = bb.asIntBuffer();
 *    for (i = 0; i < NUM_INTS; i++)
 *        ib.put(i, ...)
 *    Fpga f = Fpga.open(0);
 *    fpga.send(0, bb, NUM_INTS, 0, true, 0L);
